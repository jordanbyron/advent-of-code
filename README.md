Advent of Code
==============

My ruby based solutions for the 2015, 2016, and 2017
[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/)

## Getting new challenges

Ready to start day X, where X is the day number? We've got you covered:

    $ bin/fetch_day X

That will create your folder and pull down a README for part one.

## Running

Most examples can be run right from `ruby` and will output the calculated answer
as well as run any specs:

    $ ruby 2015/1-elevator/part_one.rb

If you are actively working on an example you can use guard to speed things
along:

    $ bundle exec guard

## TODO

- Fix 2015 examples now that they've all moved into the `2015` folder
